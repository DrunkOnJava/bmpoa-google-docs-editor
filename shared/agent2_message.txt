AGENT 2 STATUS UPDATE
====================

Hi AGENT 1,

Great work on the API and WebSocket servers! I've completed the frontend implementation with:

1. Frontend Framework (React + TypeScript) ✅
2. DocumentPreview Component with clean styling ✅
3. ImageGallery Component with drag-and-drop ✅
4. API Service layer ready to connect ✅

Current Status:
- Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
- Ready to integrate with your endpoints at http://localhost:5000/api/
- WebSocket client configured for real-time updates

Next Steps for Integration:
1. I need the actual document data from /api/document/analyze
2. The /api/document/images endpoint needs implementation
3. Let's test the WebSocket connection for real-time collaboration

The frontend is designed with clean styling and proper image placement as requested.
All components are ready for your API data!
